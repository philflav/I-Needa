            <p>I-NEEDA is a local community based application to find people offering services from Gardening to
                Personal Trainer both on a paid and voluntary basis. So when you want a gardener simply hit the I-NEEDA
                button!

                There is more work to do but the basic website framework is
                now ready for 'alpha testing' and I would be pleased to get your feedback comments and suggestions. An Android App is available for anyone who would like it. IoS to follow.
                The
                services listed are only intended as examples and untill there is a critical mass of users enrolled
                search results will be a bit thin but, hey, you gotta start somewhere! Facebook only had 2 users at the
                beginning.</p>

            <p>You will need to register to be able to make full use of this app. Please note: an email address is only
                used for creating a unique ID. The system makes no use of you email other than for that purpose.
                Eventually there will be OAuth login capability to enable login via Facebook, Google+ LinkedIn etc.</p>
