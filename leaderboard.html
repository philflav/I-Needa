            <h1>Local Service Finder</h1>

            <p>This is a work in progress project which will eventually be converted into a fully fledged app for
                Android
                and IoS. It needs a cool name!
            </p>

            <p>It is intended to be a local community based app to find people offering services from Gardening to
                Personal Trainer both on a paid and voluntary basis. There is more work to do but the basic framework is
                now ready for 'alpha testing' and I would be pleased to get your feedback comments and suggestions. </p>

            <p>You will need to register to be able to make full use of this app. Please note: an email address is only
                used for creating a unique ID. The system makes no use of you email other than for that purpose.
                Eventually there
                will be OAuth login capability to enable login via Facebook, Google+ LinkedIn etc.</p>
